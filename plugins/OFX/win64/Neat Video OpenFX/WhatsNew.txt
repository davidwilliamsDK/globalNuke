WHAT'S NEW IN THE LATEST VERSION

[+] New
[*] Changed
[-] Fixed


Neat Video OpenFX plug-in (Windows, 32-bit/64-bit)


Version 3.4

 + Added support for Nuke 7, Scratch 7, DustBuster+ 5

 * Performance optimizations for AMD/ATI GPUs
    speedups in filter modes with larger temporal radiuses:
    up to 25% in CPU+GPU mode and up to 65% in GPU-only mode

 * Improved reliability on systems with multiple OpenCL platforms
   (AMD/ATI and Intel)

 + Added support for new NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA Compute Capability 3.5
   (such as GeForce GTX Titan and Tesla K20)

 * Performance optimizations for NVIDIA GPUs
    speedups in filter modes with larger temporal radiuses and higher bitdepths:
    up to 15% in CPU+GPU mode and up to 20% in GPU-only mode

 + New Navigator panel to quickly locate areas for profiling and preview
   using a thumbnail display

 - Several minor bugs have been fixed



Version 3.3

 + Added support for AMD/ATI GPUs through OpenCL
   (GPU acceleration is now possible with both NVIDIA and AMD/ATI cards)

   The following AMD/ATI GPUs are supported:
   - ATI Radeon HD 57xx/58xx/59xx;
   - AMD Radeon HD 67xx/68xx/69xx;
   - AMD Radeon HD 77xx/78xx/79xx;
   - Another AMD/ATI GPU based on one of the following chip series:
     Juniper, Cypress, Barts, Cayman, Cape Verde, Pitcairn, Tahiti

 * Several cosmetic improvements in GUI

 * Minor corrections in the reduced brightness color theme

 - Product registration was not always preserved reliably, fixed

 - Several minor bugs have been fixed



Version 3.2

 * Updated to CUDA 4.2
   GTX 680 and newer GPUs are supported; improved performance of GPU render

 * Additional optimizations of filters for multi-core CPUs and GPUs

 + Color themes: normal and reduced brightness options, in Preferences

 - Several bugs have been fixed



Version 3.1

 + Added support for HS-ART Dustbuster; the minumum required version is Dustbuster 4.5
 + Added support for Assimilate Scratch; the minumum required version is Scratch 6.1
 
 * Improved accuracy of color channel processing in temporal filter;
   colors in fast-changing scenes are now preserved better

 * Updated to new CUDA 4 (improving compatibility with several NVIDIA GPUs)

 * Improved support for new GPUs (Compute Capability 2.x)

 * Optimized use of memory in GPU processing, making rendering more
   stable and in some cases faster

 * Improved stability of GPU processing for large frames (such as 8k)

 - In some rare cases, using CPU and GPU simultanteously could produce artifacts, fixed

 - Several bugs in GPU-based processing have been fixed

 - Number of CPU cores was determined incorrecly in Windows Server 2003
   and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, fixed

 - Rendering a project with mixed frame sizes could be unstable, fixed



Version 3.0

 Improved quality of noise reduction
 
 + Improved quality of temporal noise reduction
   The temporal filter better preserves actual details.

 + Improved accuracy of Adaptive Filtration
   Automatic adjustments to the changes in noise properties 
   along the timeline are more precise now, leading to more
   accurate noise reduction.

 
 Higher performance

 + The first GPU-accelerated version of Neat Video OpenFX plug-in

   + CUDA support
     + Faster noise reduction using CUDA-compatible GPUs
       For example, using NVIDIA GTX 470 on a computer based on Intel i7
       makes Neat Video around x2 faster.

     + CPUs and GPUs working together
       Neat Video can use CPUs and GPUs at the same time for faster processing.

     + Multiple GPU support
       Neat Video works even faster with two or more CUDA GPUs.


   + Automated optimization of performance settings for multi-core, multi-CPU and multi-GPU systems
     + Built-in Optimizer in Neat Video Preferences
     + Built-in Benchmark to measure processing speed on specific hardware

 + Additional performance optimizations
   * Faster processing: around x2 faster than in previous version
     (using CPU alone, even without involving GPU)



Version 2.6

 + The first release of Neat Video OpenFX plug-in

   All noise reduction features of traditional versions of
   Neat Video are now directly available for users of
   OpenFX-compatible host applications.
