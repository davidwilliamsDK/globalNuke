        <p class="h2_top">Great Features of Particular 2.1</p>
        <p>This page lists some of the fun and useful features in Particular. </p>
        <p class=bodystyle> <strong>Sprites and Polygons</strong><br>
Custom particles allow the use of image nodes as 2D sprites and as the new Textured Polygon type.</p>
<p class=bodystyle> <strong>Light Me Up</strong><br>
Shade all particle types from 8 lights from within Particular. Shading can emulate light falloff to make the lighting results look more natural. </p>
    <p class=bodystyle> <strong>Dynamic Self-Shadowing</strong><br>
      Shadowlet rendering can cast shadows on both main and aux particles, adding realistic self-shadowing from a single light source.</p>
  <p class=bodystyle> <strong>Full Floating-Point Support</strong><br>
      Improved bit-depth support now offers high-quality, 32 bit-per-channel rendering allowing for full-range output with HDR results. </p>
    <p class=bodystyle> <strong>Transform Your World</strong><br>
    The Transform World feature allows the entire workspace to be offset or rotated in 3D space without moving the Particular camera for increased animation flexibility. </p>
    <p class=bodystyle> <strong>New Streaklet Particles</strong><br>
    Streaklet particles resemble long-exposure light effects as seen in Apple's iPod Nano Remastered commercials. </p>
    <p class=bodystyle> <strong>Reflection Map Support</strong><br>
      Textured Polygon particles can use an image node as a reflection map to add dynamic color changes to particles as they rotate in 3D.</p>
    <p class=bodystyle> <strong>Full 3D Rotation</strong><br>
      Textured Polygon particles can be fully rotated in 3D space, with random rotation direction and speed. Also, particles can be automatically oriented in the direction of their motion.
    <p class=bodystyle> <strong>Millions and Millions of Particles</strong><br>
    The maximum particle limit now allows quick bursts of up to one million particles per second! </p>
    <p class=bodystyle> <strong>Improved Physics</strong><br>
    Particular offers support for glitch free-animation of turbulent properties. </p>
    <p class=bodystyle> <strong>Transfer Modes</strong><br>
    With Transfer Modes, you can apply Particular to other media nodes such as video footage. This is useful for adding Particular to your footage without using merge nodes. </p>
    <p class=bodystyle> <strong>Performance Optimization</strong><br>
    The render engine for Particular  is multi-threaded for much greater interactive rendering speed on multi-core machines. While Particular has many  render-intensive features, you will find that the render time is not adversely affected. Threading divides the computational load onto the existing cores to make the effect render faster.</p>
