        <p class="h2_top"><b>Physics tab&gt; Air group </b></p>
        <p class="bodystyle"> The Air group  can change particles to make them appear to move naturally through air with resistance, spin, turbulence and more.  Air  is one of two Physics Models offered in the Physics tab. The other Physics Model is the <a href="physics_bounce.html">Bounce group</a>. </p>
    <p class="bodystyle">The Air group contains   Air Resistance, Wind direction and other settings. Air  also contains two displacement  systems called <a href="physics_turb.html">Turbulence Field</a> and <a href="physics_sphere.html">Spherical Field</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> In explaining the Air controls, we will often refer to the 'spin' of a particle. By this, we mean the  circular, spring-like, random motion of particles. There is no 'Spin' setting, but there are many controls that affect this spinning motion. </p>

        <p class="h2">Air Resistance</b></p>
        <p class="bodystyle">Makes the  particle velocity decrease over time as the particle's move through space. Useful for explosions and fireworks where particles should start with a high velocity and then gradually slow down. Velocity is set with the  <a href="emitter.html">Emitter&gt; Velocity control</a>. </p>

        <p><b>Air Resistance Rotation checkbox </b></p>
        <p class="bodystyle">As 'gravity' takes over, the particles start to fall. But as 
    the particles' flight slows down, they should also stop rotating. This checkbox  stops the 
    particles' flight by decreasing their velocity. It is turned off by default.</p>
        <p class="bodystyle">When Air Resistance 
          Rotation is turned on, Air Resistance will  
          affect the rotation of particles as well as their velocity. The particles will rotate 
          fast in the beginning, but as they get slowed by  Air Resistance, their 
          rotation will decrease. This behavior helps to make the movement look natural. </p>
        <p class="bodystyle"><strong>Note:</strong> Particle rotation is set with the Particle tab&gt; <a href="particle_rotation.html">Rotation group</a>. Remember that full 3D rotation applies only to Textured Polygon particle types. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="h2"><b>Spin Amplitude</b></p>
        <p class="bodystyle">Makes particles move in randomized, circular orbits.  A value of 0 turns off the spinning motion. Low values make small circular orbits. High values make large  circular orbits. </p>
        <p class="bodystyle">This behavior is useful for adding randomness to particle motion, which makes the animation look more natural. Spin Amplitude can also be used to create a swarming look to the particles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="h2"><b>Spin Frequency</b> </p>
        <p class="bodystyle">Sets how fast the spinning particles move in their orbit. Low values mean the particles spin slowly in their orbit. Higher values make the particles spin faster. The clips below were rendered with Motion Blur to show the motion clearly. </p>

        <p class="h2"><b>Fade-in Spin [sec] </b></p>
        <p class="bodystyle">Fade-in Spin  sets how long the particle lives before it is fully affected by the spin. Measured in seconds. High values means the spin takes awhile before the spin affects the particles, making the animation fade in gradually overtime. </p>

        <p class="bodystyle">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="h2"><b>Wind X, Y, Z  </b></p>
        <p class="bodystyle">The Wind controls makes all particles move uniformly in the Wind direction. Wind X  move the particles left or right, and Wind Y move the particle up or down. Wind Z will make the particles appear to move into or out of the screen. To make the Wind more realistic, this property should be keyframed so it varies a little over time. Adding some Spin or Turbulence also helps to increase the realism.</p>

    <p class="h2"><b>Visualize Fields checkbox </b></p>
        <p class="bodystyle">This checkbox simplifies working with Turbulence Field or Spherical Field.&nbsp;When working with the Field groups, sometimes you need to know exactly how the displacement field looks. Turn this checkbox On to make all fields viewable. Doing so lets you adjust the field more easily. </p>
