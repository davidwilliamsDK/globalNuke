	<p class="h2_top">Physics tab </p>
	<p class="bodystyle">The Physics tab controls how particles move once emitted. The concepts are pretty advanced, but the controls are quite simple. The tab's initial controls are for Gravity, Time Factor and choosing a Physics Model. Once you choose the Air or Bounce model, then many other groups of controls become available, such as the <a href="physics_air.html" target="_self">Air group</a>, <a href="physics_bounce.html" target="_self">Bounce group</a>, <a href="physics_sphere.html">Spherical Field group</a> and <a href="physics_turb.html">Turbulence Field group</a>. </p>

	    <p class="bodystyle">The Physics Model determines how the particles move. Choosing a Physics Model sets the functionality for powerful Physics groups. <br>
	</p>
	<p class="bodystyle"><img src="../images/physics-model.png" width="172" height="43"></p>
	<p class="bodystyle"><br>
	There are two  Physics Model options: </p>
	<ul>
	  <li class="bodystyle"><b>Air:</b> This is the default setting. This model affects how the particles move  through the air. The Air group has properties for  forces like Air Resistance, Spin and Wind controls to push and pull on the particles. When Air is chosen, three Physics groups become active: Air group, Turbulence Field group and Spherical Field group. See the <a href="physics_air.html" target="_self">Air group</a> page. </li>
	  <li class="bodystyle"><b>Bounce:</b> With this model, particles can bounce against up to two other  nodes in the composition. When Bounce is chosen, the Bounce group becomes active. See the <a href="physics_bounce.html" target="_self">Bounce group</a> page. </li>
    </ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="h2">Gravity</p>
		<p class="bodystyle">Gravity makes particles fall downwards in a natural way. The particles pick up speed as they fall, just like any object in real world. Low values make the particles fall slowly. High values make the particles fall more quickly. The Gravity  can  be set to negative values to make particles appear to float up instead of down over time.</p>

		<p class="h2">Physics Time Factor</b></p>
		<p class="bodystyle">Sets the rate of the simulation or how quickly or slowly particles are generated by Particular. This control enables full control over physical time. The particles can be made to move faster, slow down, completely freeze or move backwards. This is useful for creating stop-time effects such as freezing an explosion or fireworks simulation in place and moving the camera to show a different view and then restarting the simulation.</p>
		<p class="bodystyle"> To freeze time, the Physics Time Factor control has to be keyframed down to 0. If it is  set to 0, no particles will ever be born. You can keyframe from 0 to another value to make the particles appear again. Higher values make the particle simulation rate go faster, while negative values will run the simulation in reverse. </p>
		<p class="bodystyle">To better explain Physics Time Factor, we have created the two  examples shown below. At left, the camera perspective rotates around   the particles, and the particles animate without any Time Factor interference.   At right, we have keyframed the Physics Time Factor control  to slow the particles  during the camera move. The particles stop moving halfway through the comp as the camera rotates around them. We created this effect by setting a keyframe with a Time Factor value of 1, then a keyframe value of 0, then another keyframe value of 0, then  a fourth keyframe value of 1. With this animation, we have successfully frozen time! </p>
