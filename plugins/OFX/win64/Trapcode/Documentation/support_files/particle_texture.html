		<p class="h2_top"><b>Particle tab&gt; Texture group </b></p>
		<p class="bodystyle">The Texture group  affects the custom image used for the Sprite and Texture Polygon particles. Texture controls set the particle's behavior, such as specifying which frame of the image to sample from. </p>
		<p class="bodystyle">To  choose the  image node, you use Particular's <a href="inputports.html">Particle input port</a>. Read  how to work with a custom particle on our <a href="particle_custom.html">Custom Particles page</a>. </p>

	<p class="h2">Layer Duration </p>
		<p class="bodystyle">Duration sets how many frames of the  image  should be recognized. </p>
	<p class="bodystyle">If you have imported  a still image like a JPEG, that Layer Duration would be 1 frame. Technically, you don't have to set Layer Duration for a still image, because Particular will just repeat that single frame forever. </p>
		<p class="bodystyle">For an image sequence or video, you can tell Particular how many frames  that sequence or video is.  For a 4 frame animation, set  Duration to 4. For a 170 frame animation, set Layer Duration to 170. </p>
		<p class="bodystyle">Alternately, you can decide how many of those  frames  you want Particular to pay attention to. Let's say you imported a 170 frame animation, but you only want to use  half of the animation. Set  Layer Duration to 85 if you want to look at only the first 85 frames.</p>

	<p class="h2"><b>Time Sampling </b></p>
		<p class="bodystyle"> Time Sampling determines which frame of the image is sampled to generate the Texture. There are 11 modes. The mode determines which frame the texture is sampled from with options for starting from the first frame, picking a random frame, or splitting the layer source into multiple clips.</p>
	    <p class="bodystyle">The default choice is Current Time. If the custom particle is a still image, the mode should always be set to Current Time. This option will speed up rendering because  the same frame of the image is used for all particles in the current frame.</p>
		<p class="style2"> When using an animated particle, the other modes are  useful.  
The Start, Random and Split modes can drastically reduce the  time needed to pre-render the custom particle image. Following is an explanation of how each works. </p>

        <p class="bodystyle"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Split Clip modes split the custom image into a number of clips. The number is set with the  Number of Clips control.

This is useful for creating a set of animated particles from one image source. </font></p>
